# Chess

## Summary

This repository holds the frontend and backend code for a full-stack Chess game application. Intended for web-based user interfaces, the frontend is built in VueJS and the backend is in Node.js to perform game logic between clients.

I started this project with the intention of preparing to create my Game of Generals game. Since Chess already has several examples of how to implement board game principles in code, this project will be a stepping stone for me to have tech prerequisites to build the Game of Generals game.

## Project Status

This Project is currently in an incomplete, holding status. When the holding status is lifted, backend business logic will be prioritized before the frontend.

## Repository Contents

- `app`: This is the VueJS frontend Chess game client that players would interact with to view the board and provide their move choices.
- `backend`: This is the Node.js backend code that will support game logic for the game to happen between players over a network.
